## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images shown are ones of the now obselete "MiniDisc" music format, introduced by Sony in 1992. These include the actual music discs and the player that my father purchased brand new in 1998, then used in the early 2000s up until we moved to New Zealand.

My effect is meant to represent how computer graphics looked in the early 90s when MiniDisc was first introduced. Colour was very limited as some machines can only render up four thousand colours, as opposed to the sixteen-or-so million that modern machines can display. I've exaggeratted this effect so that my images only use four grey scale colours.

The masks for each image have this particular effect applied to showcase how these objects are a relic of a not-so-distant past. I have a colour and colourless version of the generator.
